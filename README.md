# 2d-Spatial-Data-Histogram-Transfer-Function-Filter
Exercise on 2d Spatial Data, Histogram, Transfer Function, Filter

This is an exercise on how to manipulate 2d Spatial Data. 
# Dataset
The data consider is one slice of a CT angiographic scan. You can find it in the repository (slice150.raw). Data set and descriptions
(TermsOfUse_slice150.txt and DataCharacteristics_slice150.txt) are provided  as well.
Data is stored as 16-bit integer values.
# Tasks
(a) Draw a profile line through line 256 of this 2D data set.
(b) Calculate the mean value and the variance value of this 2D data set.
(c) Display a histogram of this 2D data set (instead of bars you may use a line graph to link occurrences along
the x-axis).
(d) Rescale values to range between 0 and 255 using a linear transformation.
(e) Rescale values to range between 0 and 255 using a different (e.g. non-linear) transformation.
(f) Use an 11x11 boxcar smoothing filter on the 2D data set.
(g) Use an 11x11 median filter on the 2D data set.
# Output
The output for the subtasks for (b) is  (d)-(g)
